# Springboard Data Science Career Track

Code, small sized data, and files for my two capstone projects and all the mini projects  I have done for the Springboard data science career track are included in this repository. 

# Capstone Project 1

## [Predicting the Gender of the Consumer using Black Friday Dataset](https://github.com/caixuansun/Springboard/tree/master/capstone_project_1)
The goal for this project is to predict the gender of the consumer to help the retail store to make more targeted marketing strategy. 

Models Used:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

The best performing model is **Gradient Boosting Classifier**.

# Capstone Project 2

## [Building A Recommender System for Instacart](https://github.com/caixuansun/Springboard/tree/master/capstone_project_2)

This project aims to build a recommender system for Instacart using their open source data. Useful insights about customer's preference could be extracted based on what they have consumed previously and then we can infer what products they might be interested in. 

Models Used:

- Benchmark: non-personalized popularity model
- Matrix Factorization
- Neighborhood-based Model

**Matrix Factorization** is performing the best. 

# Spark 

## [Spark DF, SQL, ML](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/3692881074123423/3772991543552237/1364486686788698/latest.html)

In this exercise, we play with Spark Datasets & Dataframes, Spark SQL, and build classification models using Spark ML in the Databricks environment. 

# Machine Learning

## [Linear Regression Practice](https://github.com/caixuansun/Springboard/tree/master/linear_regression)

 Predict Boston housing price. 
## [Logistic Regression Practice](https://github.com/caixuansun/Springboard/tree/master/logistic_regression)

Classify a sample as female or male based on weight and height data. 

## [Naive Bayes Practice](https://github.com/caixuansun/Springboard/tree/master/naive_bayes)

Text classification using movie reviews from the rotten tomatoes database. 

## [Clustering](https://github.com/caixuansun/Springboard/tree/master/clustering)

Customer segmentation.

Models Used:

- K-Means Clustering
- Affinity Propagation
- Spectral Clustering
- Agglomerative Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Visualize Clusters using PCA

# EDA

## [Human Temperature Analysis](https://github.com/caixuansun/Springboard/tree/master/EDA_human_temperature)

Analyze a dataset of human body temperatures and employ the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance. 

## [Racial Discrimination Analysis](https://github.com/caixuansun/Springboard/tree/master/EDA_racial_discrimination)

Perform statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.

## [Hospital Readmissions Analysis](https://github.com/caixuansun/Springboard/tree/master/EDA_hospital_readmit)

Construct a statistically sound analysis and make recommendations for reducing the readmissions rate. 

# Data Wrangling

## [Working with JSON](https://github.com/caixuansun/Springboard/tree/master/data_wrangling_json)

## [Working with API Data](https://github.com/caixuansun/Springboard/tree/master/API_data_wrangling)

## [SQL Practice](https://github.com/caixuansun/Springboard/blob/master/sql_practice.sql)
